<b>Poe, E.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near a Raven</b>
<br>Midnights so dreary, tired and weary.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silently pondering volumes extolling all by-now
obsolete lore.
<br>During my rather long nap - the weirdest tap!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An ominous vibrating sound disturbing my chamber's
antedoor.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This", I whispered quietly,
"I ignore".
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Perfectly, the intellect remembers: the ghostly fires, a glittering
ember.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inflamed by lightning's outbursts, windows cast
penumbras upon this floor.
<br>Sorrowful, as one mistreated, unhappy thoughts I heeded:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That inimitable lesson in elegance - Lenore -
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is delighting, exciting...nevermore.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Ominously, curtains parted (my serenity outsmarted),
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And fear overcame my being - the fear of "forevermore".
<br>Fearful foreboding abided, selfish sentiment confided,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said, "Methinks mysterious traveler knocks
afore.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man is visiting, of age
threescore."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Taking little time, briskly addressing something: "Sir," (robustly)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell what source originates clamorous noise afore?
<br>Disturbing sleep unkindly, is it you a-tapping, so slyly?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, devil incarnate!--" Here completely unveiled
I my antedoor--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just darkness, I ascertained
- nothing more.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>While surrounded by darkness then, I persevered to clearly comprehend.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I perceived the weirdest dream...of everlasting
"nevermores".
<br>Quite, quite, quick nocturnal doubts fled - such relief! - as my intellect
said,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Desiring, imagining still) that perchance the apparition
was uttering a whispered "Lenore".
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This only, as evermore.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Silently, I reinforced, remaining anxious, quite scared, afraid,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While intrusive tap did then come thrice - O, so
stronger than sounded afore.
<br>"Surely" (said silently) "it was the banging, clanging window lattice."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glancing out, I quaked, upset by horrors hereinbefore,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perceiving: a "nevermore".
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Completely disturbed, I said, "Utter, please, what prevails ahead.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repose, relief, cessation, or but more dreary 'nevermores'?"
<br>The bird intruded thence - O, irritation ever since! -
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then sat on Pallas' pallid bust, watching me (I
sat not, therefore),
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And stated "nevermores".
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Bemused by raven's dissonance, my soul exclaimed, "I seek intelligence;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explain thy purpose, or soon cease intoning forlorn
'nevermores'!"
<br>"Nevermores", winged corvus proclaimed - thusly was a raven named?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually maintain a surname, upon Pluvious seashore?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard an oppressive "nevermore".
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>My sentiments extremely pained, to perceive an utterance so plain,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most interested, mystified, a meaning I hoped for.
<br>"Surely," said the raven's watcher, "separate discourse is wiser.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, liberation I'll obtain, retreating heretofore
-
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eliminating all the 'nevermores'
".
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Still, the detestable raven just remained, unmoving, on sculptured bust.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Always saying "never" (by a red chamber's door).
<br>A poor, tender heartache maven - a sorrowful bird - a raven!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O, I wished thoroughly, forthwith, that he'd fly
heretofore.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still sitting, he recited
"nevermores".
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The raven's dirge induced alarm - "nevermore" quite wearisome.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I meditated: "Might its utterances summarize of
a calamity before?"
<br>O, a sadness was manifest - a sorrowful cry of unrest;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "O," I thought sincerely, "it's a melancholy great
- furthermore,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Removing doubt, this explains
'nevermores' ".
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Seizing just that moment to sit - closely, carefully, advancing beside
it,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sinking down, intrigued, where velvet cushion lay
afore.
<br>A creature, midnight-black, watched there - it studied my soul, unawares.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore, explanations my insight entreated for.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silently, I pondered the
"nevermores".
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Disentangle, nefarious bird! Disengage - I am disturbed!"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intently its eye burned, raising the cry within
my core.
<br>"That delectable Lenore - whose velvet pillow this was, heretofore,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Departed thence, unsettling my consciousness therefore.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's returning - that maiden
- aye, nevermore."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Since, to me, that thought was madness, I renounced continuing sadness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continuing on, I soundly, adamantly forswore:
<br>"Wretch," (addressing blackbird only) "fly swiftly - emancipate me!"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Respite, respite, detestable raven - and discharge
me, I implore!"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A ghostly answer of: "nevermore".
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>" 'Tis a prophet? Wraith? Strange devil? Or the ultimate evil?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Answer, tempter-sent creature!", I inquired, like
before.
<br>"Forlorn, though firmly undaunted, with 'nevermores' quite indoctrinated,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is everything depressing, generating great sorrow
evermore?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am subdued!", I then swore.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In answer, the raven turned - relentless distress it spurned.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Comfort, surcease, quiet, silence!" - pleaded I
for.
<br>"Will my (abusive raven!) sorrows persist unabated?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevermore Lenore respondeth?", adamantly I encored.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The appeal was ignored.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"O, satanic inferno's denizen -- go!", I said boldly, standing then.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take henceforth loathsome "nevermores" - O, to
an ugly Plutonian shore!
<br>Let nary one expression, O bird, remain still here, replacing mirth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promptly leave and retreat!", I resolutely swore.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blackbird's riposte: "nevermore".
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>So he sitteth, observing always, perching ominously on these doorways.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Squatting on the stony bust so untroubled, O therefore.
<br>Suffering stark raven's conversings, so I am condemned, subserving,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To a nightmare cursed, containing miseries galore.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus henceforth, I'll rise
(from a darkness, a grave) -- nevermore!
